Work for the final project of Information Visualization; the 2017 MC1 VAST challenge using D3.

This code aims to analyze and find unusual activity by visitors to a nature park. To do so, my D3 analysis focuses on visualizing paths taken through the park, both overlayed onto the map and as a live view with estimated vehicle positions.

Most of my work is in mcroutes1.js, and the index.html document attached is meant to be launched as a website.
